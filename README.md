# Cap-stone UI

An e-commerce application I developed for my capstone project powered by Angular 17 (Note this isn't production ready).

## Getting Started

You'll need the backend up and running (if it is not public, I have not decided to open-source it).

## Architecture

Project is split into two different fronts.

1. [Store Front](https://capstone.emmanueluluabuike.com/) : This is where customers visit to purchase products.
2. [Admin Front](https://capstone.emmanueluluabuike.com/admin) : This is where employees or staff manage products.

## 3rd Party Technologies

The project utilizes several third-party technologies:

- Tailwind CSS.
- Angular Material UI.
- CKEditor5.
- Paystack: A payment gateway for processing online payments.

## Building Docker Image

### Using Dockerfile

- `docker build --tag <chose-a-name>:latest . --progress=plain --build-arg="PORT=<choose-a-port-number>"`

### Using Buildpacks

- [Install pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/)
- Set default `pack config default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base`
  or `pack config default-builder <you-builder-choice>`
- Convert to image `pack build <image-name> -b paketo-buildpacks/web-servers
--env "BP_WEB_SERVER=nginx"
--env "BP_WEB_SERVER_ROOT=dist/capstone"
--env "BP_WEB_SERVER_ENABLE_PUSH_STATE=true"
--env "NODE_ENV=development"`
